DESCRIPTION:
    This sample demonstrates how to use agent operations with the File Search tool from
    the Azure Agents service using a synchronous client.

USAGE:
    python file_search.py

    Before running the sample:

    pip install azure-ai-projects azure-identity

    Set these environment variables with your own values:
    PROJECT_ENDPOINT - The Azure AI Project endpoint, as found in your AI Studio Project.
    MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME - The deployment name of the AI model.
